# what is NumPy:
# NumPy is python library used for working with arrays. It also has function for  working in domain of linear algebra,fourier transform and matrices.


# Numpy stands for Numerical Python

# why use NumPy:
# In Python we have lists that serve the purpose of arrays, but they are slow to process.
# NumPy aims to provide an array objects that is up to 50x faster than tradition python lists.

# why is NumPy faster than Lists:
# NumPy arrays are stroed at on e continous place in memory unlike lists, so process can access and manipulate them very efficiency.
